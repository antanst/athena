## Why athena?

Because it's a simple, yet aesthetically pure, static blog generator with
paramount focus on the reading experience. As a WordPress user since 2007, I
think it's time for a change. Other static blog generators are too feature
heavy and bloated. athena just works.

### Why Tufte CSS?

Edward Tufteâ€™s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes,
tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.
